# math_parser_rs
This repository was created to learn Rust, as simple as that. Rust's versatile pattern matching has reduced the size of the interpreter significantly, and increased the type safety guarantees that cannot be as easily achieved in a traditional object oriented programming language, such as C# (See [Math Expression Parsing](https://github.com/Jwaffled/MathExpressionParsing)).
